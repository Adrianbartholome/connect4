# connect4
A text-based Connect Four game written in python on Pydroid 3 for Android.

Very basic AI. really, nothing specila. It was just fun to build in some free time on my phone over a couple of days.
Choose a number to drop your piece into that corresponding column. The AI will follow, attempting to block you from 
making four in a row. 

Players pieces are represented by a 'O'
AI pieces are represented by a '@'

When a winner is found, the four winning pieces are replaced with '!'
